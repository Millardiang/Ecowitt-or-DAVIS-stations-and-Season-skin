Based on the new structure of the Seasons skin (sensor management in array) I have the Seasons Skin
extended accordingly so that all possible sensor data of the Ecowitt stations/devices are displayed.
There is also the option of displaying the air quality index for AQI EPA (US) or AQI EEA (EU).
It currently contains all database values from the weewx_extended database schema
and now Ecowitt database schema weewx_ecowitt and loop values of
Ecowitt (Interceptor: ecowitt-client) or GW1000 driver, VantagePro, Davis Weatherlink Live, Davis AirLink
In order to get all data from the Ecowitt stations/devices, you have to use my modified interceptor driver
or GW1000 driver.

My array offers these possibilities:
  at current.inc example for outside temperature:
  ('outTemp', '#e85d0d', 'current', '1')
  or
  ('outTemp','#e85d0d','day','1')
  (1:value, 2:labelcolor, ''=black, 3:current or day or yesterday or aqiepa or aqieea or trend or deltatime or wx_binding?, 4:'1')
  3: = current -> default
  3: = day -> show avages of the day
  3: = yesterday -> show avages of the last day
  3: = 3:yesterday -> at 1:radiation  -> radiation.energy_integral.kilowatt_hour_per_meter_squared for yesterday and day
  3: = trend -> show additonal to value the 24hr trend or 3 hr trend (barometer)
  3: = deltatime -> for sunShineDur or rainDur or hailDur
  3: = 'wx_binding?' -> example: 'wx_binding3, WS90' Data are from the Database settings 'wx_binding3' and here additional to the label is ' WS90' added
  3: = 'daywx_bindig?' or 'trendwx_bindging?' are also allowed. example: 'daywx_binding3, Ultrasonic'
  3: = aqiepa -> computes pm2_5 Air quality Index EPA
  3: = aqieea -> computes pm2_5 Air quality Index EEA
  4: = 1 show, 4: = 0 don't show, although values are available, 4: = 3 Textinformation or Separation

at hilo.inc and statistics.inc
  observ-Array -> (1:value, 2:labelcolor, ''=black, 3:''=min&max or max or sum or wx_binding?, 4:don't show, although values are available = 0)
  ('outTemp', '#e85d0d', '', '1'),
  1: value
  2: label color, if '' = black
  3: which evaluation , '' (= empty = min and max), or sum, or only max
  3: ='wx_binding?' or 'sumwx_binding?' or 'maxwx_binding?' or 'minwx_binding?' or 'avgwx_binding?' or 'maxwx_binding?, Text' or ...
  -> example: 'wx_binding3, WS90' or 'maxwx_binding3, WS90' Data are from the Database settings 'wx_binding3' and here additional to the label is ' WS90' added
  4: show if available, if 0 never show (e.g. for indoor temperature)
  labelcolor can be general disabled -> #set $usefontcolor = 0


In addition, the skin also takes into account that the Ecowitt stations / devices use the unit "%" for the soil moisture values
  and not "cb" as specified centrally in Weewx
  In general, a label color can be used with
  #set $usefontcolor = 0
  be switched off
  The order in the array is also the display position.

Example for the skin:

Calculation of the sunshine duration:
https://github.com/Jterrettaz/sunduration
Which, however, was modified by me https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx/user/sunduration.zip
and the configuration is done via the weewx.conf and this entry:

Code:
[RadiationDays]
min_sunshine = 120 	# Entry of extension radiationhours.py, if is installed (= limit value)
sunshine_log = 0 	# should not be logged when sunshine is recorded
sunshine_coeff = 0.8 	# Factor from which value sunshine is counted - the higher the later
sunshine_min = 18 	# below this value (W/mÂ²), sunshine is not taken into account.

... and if you want to rummage through the files, there are even more changes from me:
https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx

################################################# ###############################################

There is also a complete installation file for the Interceptor driver and GW1000 driver (both) with the
Ecowitt extension and the Seasons skin change
https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx/weewx-gw1000_interceptor.zip

Download the file, upload it to the RaspPi, change to the directory where uploaded to and with
sudo wee_extension --install=weewx-gw1000_interceptor.zip


Only Interceptor: 
https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx/weewx-interceptor.zip
sudo wee_extension --install=weewx-interceptor.zip

 or
sudo wee_extension --install=/%path_where_file_located%/weewx-???.zip
to install.

Both use a new database schema: 
wview_ecowitt.py

An existing database can also be expanded with these shell scripts:
  -> is very likely the easiest way
 
https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx/add_ecowitt_to_wview_database.zip
https://www.pc-wetterstation.de/weewx/add_ecowitt_to_wview_extended_database.zip

  The new data fields are added to the existing database and the old ones
  Data are retained.
  If you don't work with the standard configuration (/etc/weewx/weewx.conf), you have to
  adjust the --config=/etc/weewx/weewx.conf entry accordingly.

################################################# ################################################
In weewx.conf you can/should use the existing entry (only useful with a completely new installation) for 
Code:
[DataBindings]
     [[wx_binding]]
        schema = schemas.wview.schema
        "#schema" = schemas.wview_ecowitt.schema # -> is entered in this way by the installation!
# Change to
        #schema = schemas.wview.schema
        schema = schemas.wview_ecowitt.schema

Possibly also the database name from weewx.sdb to weewx_ecowitt.sdb
to change.
Code:
[Databases]
     # A SQLite database is simply a single file
     [[archive_sqlite]]
         database_name = weewx.sdb
         database_type = SQLite
         "#database_name" = weewx_ecowitt.sdb
Since the installation routine does not change any existing entries, one must in weewx.conf
adapt a few entries

Signal assignment with GW1000 driver (the interceptor cannot evaluate the signals)
The weewx-gw1000.zip installation routine adds these entries to weewx.conf:
[StdCalibrate]
    [[Corrections]]
        #rxCheckPercent = ws80_sig * 25 if ws80_sig is not None else None
        #rxCheckPercent = wh24_sig * 25 if wh24_sig is not None else None
        #rxCheckPercent = wh25_sig * 25 if wh25_sig is not None else None
        #rxCheckPercent = wh65_sig * 25 if wh65_sig is not None else None
        #rxCheckPercent = wh68_sig * 25 if wh68_sig is not None else None
        #signal1 = wh24_sig * 25 if wh24_sig is not None else None
        #signal2 = wh31_ch1_sig * 25 if wh31_ch1_sig is not None else None
        #signal3 = wh34_ch1_sig * 25 if wh34_ch1_sig is not None else None
        #signal4 = wh40_sig * 25 if wh40_sig is not None else None
        #signal5 = wh45_sig * 25 if wh45_sig is not None else None
        #signal6 = wh57_sig * 25 if wh57_sig is not None else None
        #signal7 = wh51_ch1_sig * 25 if wh51_ch1_sig is not None else None
        #signal8 = wh35_ch1_sig * 25 if wh35_ch1_sig is not None else None

So are not active and is an example:
Here everyone can choose for themselves which signals should be assigned to which Ecowitt sensor sig.
signal 1..8 belongs to the database values, with the assignment they are also recorded for evaluation.

Code:
[Station]

# Set to type of station hardware. There must be a corresponding stanza
# in this file with a 'driver' parameter indicating the driver to be used.
  station_type = Interceptor		# with interceptor driver
  #station_type = gw1000			# with GW1000 driver
